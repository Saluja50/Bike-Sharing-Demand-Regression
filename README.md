# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction – Regression Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting bike sharing demand using historical data and regression-based machine learning models. The goal is to understand the factors influencing bike rentals and build a predictive model to estimate demand.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical bike sharing data
- Identify key factors affecting bike rental demand
- Build and evaluate regression models
- Compare model performance using appropriate metrics

## 📊 Dataset
- Bike sharing dataset containing weather, seasonal, and temporal features
- Target variable: bike rental count

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression model building
- Model evaluation (R², MAE, RMSE)

## 📈 Key Insights
- Weather and seasonal factors significantly influence bike demand
- Temperature and hour of the day are strong predictors
- Regression models provide reliable demand estimates with good accuracy
